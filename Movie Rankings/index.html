<h1>The Best Movies According to Vinzce</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Ready Player One</h3>
<p>
    One of my favorite movies because of all the references
    and game setting.
</p>

<h3>Top Gun: Maverick</h3>
<p>
    The story is amazing that follows the story of the first movie.
    Also the jet scenes were amazing.
</p>

<h3>Norbit</h3>
<p>
    Not an awards winning movie by far but one of the funniest.
    Love to watch it whenever I want a good laugh.
